This is a desktop application that I created to learn more about OOP in Java as
well as Java FX and FXML and the MVC pattern. This is an inventory management
application, it is strictly a UI and the data is not persistent (no database or
files, data lives and dies with the application). I used both in-line CSS and a
referenced CSS file to style the skin of the application and all of the FXML was
written by hand (did not use scene builder or any other tools). The part class
was provided by a third party and intentionally does not have any javadoc comments.
